## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS preprocessor

### What I learned

I learnt how to use SASS preprocessor in writting CSS and the DRY concept in coding.
I also utilized the Grid system in making responsive layouts for different screensizes

The use of Pseudo selectors was also used as seen below.


```css
.showcase-rating:nth-child(2){
    position: relative;
    left: 2.5rem;
}

.showcase-rating:nth-child(3){
    position: relative;
    left: 5rem;
}
```

### Continued development

For continued development, More indepth use of SASS will be employed to make The CSS writting less repettive


### Useful resources

- [W3schools SASS Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/) - This helped me for Understanding how to use and apply SASS in a project. The documentation was really detailed and straightforward

<!-- - [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. -->
